# SuperCoolArchInstall
my own little arch install script.

Only has 3 prompts:
1. Choose disk to format
2. Ask root/user password
3. Ask hostname

All other stuf is hardcoded for me:
1. Installs `chaotic-aur` and `multilib` repos
2. Uses my own mirrorlist from this repo
3. Uses `America/Edmonton` timezone
4. Pre-installs: `yay`, `fastfetch`, and `steam`
5. Creates user named `logan`
